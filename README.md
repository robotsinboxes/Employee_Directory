# Employee Directory

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. 
Sorting by department, name, or contact information makes getting the information efficiently and easy.

In this app, you can view the employees in The Office and sort by name, role or email.

This app is incomplete. Sorting functionality works, but search bar does not and needs styling corrections.

Built with React, Bootstrap.
